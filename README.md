## project Description
Analyzing Realestate Data set with data preprocessing for machine learning
- starting with russian real estate data that requires to get analysed to see the main features and relationship between each feature to gain and extract useful
 insights that will be usefull to decision makers and to let them take a good actions according to those insights, and then finally after analysing the data the problem is that we have to prepare the data for the modeling phase (feature engineering, encoding, handling outliers, handling nans..etc). 
- using statistical methods to analyse and extracting information from the dataset like (features distributions, centeral tendancy, measure of despersion and many, boxplots and many other statistical techniques ?
- tools that i have used are ( Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, re, warnings, plotly, seaborn, functions(python file made by me in the above files), sklearn, category_encoders, geopy, power bi)
